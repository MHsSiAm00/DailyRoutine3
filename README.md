"Organised task, quarter done."
DailyRoutine is a modern, glassmorphic Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to streamline your daily schedule. Built with a focus on minimalist design and speed, it allows users to manage subjects, take dedicated notes, and stay on track with real-time "active task" highlighting.

✨ Features
🌟 Alpha Phase Improvements
 * Modern Glassmorphism: A beautiful UI featuring frosted glass effects, blur filters, and smooth animated transitions.
 * Splash Screen: A branded entry experience with an automated loading sequence.
 * Integrated Note System: Gone are the "global notes." Now, every subject has its own dedicated interactive icon for note-taking.
 * Mode Switching: A dedicated "Edit Mode" allows you to add/remove subjects, keeping the "View Mode" static and distraction-free.
 * Smart Highlighting: The current task glows and scales automatically based on your local time.
 * Safety First: Added confirmation warnings before deleting any subject to prevent accidental data loss.
📱 PWA Ready
 * Offline Support: Works without internet once installed.
 * Installable: Add it to your home screen on Android or iOS.
 * Fast Loading: Optimized Service Worker for instant startup.
🛠️ Tech Stack
 * HTML5 / CSS3: Custom Glassmorphism styles and CSS animations.
 * JavaScript (ES6): Logic for scheduling, real-time updates, and local storage.
 * SVG: Lightweight, scalable icons and splash branding.
 * Manifest & Service Worker: Powering the PWA capabilities.
